== Camel Example Kamelet Chuck Norris

=== Introduction

This example shows how you can build a simple Kamelet and use with your Camel applications.

The kamelet is created as a YAML file in the `src/main/resources/kamelets' directory.
We have developed a Chuck Norris Kamelet that periodically gets a joke from the Chuck Norris internet database.

A Camel routes is _coded_ in OSGi Blueprint in the `src/main/resources/OSGI-INF/blueprint/camel-context.xml` file
using the XML DSL that uses the Kamelet, and log the result from the Kamelet to the console.

=== Build

You will need to compile this example first:

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn compile
----

=== Run

You can run this example using

[source,sh]
----
$ mvn camel-karaf:run
----

=== Run with Karaf

You will need to install this example first to your local maven
repository with:

....
mvn install
....

Then you can install this example from the shell using this exampleâ€™s
`+features.xml+` for easy provisioning:

....
feature:repo-add mvn:org.apache.camel.example/camel-example-kamelet-chucknorris/${version}/xml/features
feature:install camel-example-kamelet-chucknorris
....

And you can see the application running by tailing the logs:

....
log:tail
....

And you can use ctrl+c to stop tailing the log.
